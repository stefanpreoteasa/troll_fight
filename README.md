troll_fight
===========

text based game I made to exercise Python skills

Fight the trolls with SWORDS & MAGIC!

Things I wanted to exercise:
  Modularity in design (i.e. thinking ahead)
  
  Multiple funtions structures
  
  Classes, constructors
  
  Loops
  
  Regex (though justa bit)
  
  Friendly interface design (kidding)
